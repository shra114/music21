Well, welcome back. The song I just played for you there was an original song called Something in C. I called it Something in C because it's in the key of C major. That was our tonal center. That was the key that the song was it. We're going to talk a little bit more about tonal centers in just a little bit. But first, I want to do a quick review from what we did in lesson one. How many of you all remember the C major scale, how it's constructed? Whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step, C major scale. What is an interval? Right. The distance between two notes. How about defining harmony? What is that? Harmony is, very good. Harmony is that basically you're talking about chords, scales, and melodies. What is ear training? Right. Ear training, your ear. Identifying what it's hearing, and we're going to be doing exercise to help you to hear more accurately, very, very good.
