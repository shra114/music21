So, we've covered a lot of things in this first lesson, and what I'm going to do now is tell you what I'd like for you to work on and tell you some homework assignments I have for you. The first homework assignment I want you to explain or define, in your own words, those three main terms we talked about. I want you to write your own definition for ear training, your own definition for harmony, and your own definition for intervals. So, that's three different definitions. You can take the definition that I gave you or the one that's on the screen, and just modify it, so that you can articulate it to a friend of yours who maybe doesn't know music. That's the first homework assignment. The second homework assignment is, I'd like for you to find at least three recordings of preexisting songs that are in the key of C major. We've talked about tonal centers, the keys of the songs, you need to recognize three songs that are in the key of C. Okay? That's homework assignment number two. Homework assignment number three is, I would like for you to write a C major scale on the staff. Okay? You'll write C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. Now, there's support materials there to help you out, but I just want you to get used to writing notes on the staff. Okay? They can be whole notes, half notes, quarter notes. We haven't talked about note durations yet, but you can use any one you want. Whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, just write the notes on the staff. That's what's most important. Well, let me play that major scale song again for you. Whole step, whole step, half-step. Whole step, whole step, whole step, half-step. Whole step, whole step, half-step. Whole step, whole step, half-step, half. Whole step, whole step, half-step. Whole step, whole step, whole step, half-step. See you next week.
