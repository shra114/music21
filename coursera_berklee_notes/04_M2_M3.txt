Now, I'd like to focus on two intervals. The first interval being the major second. From C to D, la, la, can you sing that with me? La, la, major second, la, la. Major second, la, la. Okay. That will be a major second. If I started a major second from the G, la la la la, now you sing it. La la la la, major second, la la, major second, la la. That will be a major second. Major second, la la. Okay. Now, the next interval I'd like to talk about is the major third. Major third would be simply, C to E. In the key of C one to three. That would be a major third. La la la la, sing that with me. La la la la major third, la la major third, la la, come on sing it a little bit louder. Major third, la la. Major third, la la. Let's start on another note. How about we start on F? Major third, la la. Major third, la la, come on say a little louder. Major third, la la. Major third, la la. Okay. Once again, major second. Major third. I'm going to play, and you let me know, if it's a major second or a major third. Here we go, number one. Number one again. Okay. Number two. Number two again. Number three. Number three again. Number four. Number four again. Number five. Number five again. Number six. Number six again. How did you do. Great, great. Major second, major third intervals. Good job guys.
