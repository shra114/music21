Now, from time to time during the six weeks, you may hear the term flat or sharp. Now, those terms simply mean to raise or lower a note by a half step. For instance, this is an A, an A-flat would be to lower the note a half step to A-flat. A-sharp would simply mean raise the note a half step, A-sharp. Let's take another note how about the note of D? That's a D. A D-flat would be, lower the note a half step. A D-sharp would be to raise that note a half step. Let's take F which is a very interesting one because if you lowered F, it would come down a half step to E because as with B and C, E and F have no dark note, has no black note in between. So F, F-flat would be, also known as E. F-sharp would be, raise you have F-sharp. Sharps and flats.
